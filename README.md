# NYC Taxi Trip End to End Cloud Data Pipeline and Data Analysis Project

## Introduction
This NYC Taxi Trip Analytics project is an innovative end-to-end Data Engineering pipeline designed to transform urban mobility data into actionable business intelligence. The workflow begins by sourcing Yellow Taxi and Green Taxi data from NYC TLC, followed by storing raw data efficiently in AWS S3 buckets. The data is then meticulously transformed using dbt to ensure accuracy and completeness before being loaded into Snowflake for advanced analytics and querying. To orchestrate the entire process, Apache Airflow automates the data pipeline, while Looker Studio creates visually compelling dashboards that reveal urban movement patterns.

With its well-orchestrated cloud-native architecture, this project exemplifies modern data engineering practices by seamlessly integrating data ingestion, transformation, storage, and visualization into a unified solution. The pipeline processes millions of daily trips to uncover hidden insights about New York City's transportation dynamics, pricing optimization opportunities, and temporal-spatial demand patterns.

## Project Description

## Dataset Description
The TLC Trip Record Data is a comprehensive and publicly available dataset curated by the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission. It contains detailed information for hundreds of millions of individual trips taken in Yellow Taxis, Green Taxis, and For-Hire Vehicles (FHVs) like those from Uber and Lyft. For each trip, the data typically includes precise timestamps for pickup and drop-off, the geographic locations (as taxi zone IDs or latitude/longitude coordinates), the trip distance and duration, the itemized fare and toll amounts, the number of passengers, and the method of payment.

```

## 📊 Key Analytics & Insights

### 1. Trip Pattern Analysis
- **Peak Hours Heatmap**: Identifies busiest times across days of the week
  - Weekday morning rush (7-9 AM) and evening rush (5-7 PM) show highest demand
  - Saturday nights exhibit extended peak periods (8 PM - midnight)

### 2. Geographic Distribution
- **Location Matrix**: Cross-tabulation of pickup/dropoff locations
  - Manhattan dominates with 362K+ intra-borough trips
  - Strong connections between Manhattan-Queens and Manhattan-Brooklyn corridors
  - Airport (EWR) trips show distinct patterns

### 3. Trip Characteristics
- **Duration Segments**:
  - 73% of trips complete within 10-20 minutes
  - Only 4% exceed 30 minutes, indicating efficient urban mobility
- **Distance Analysis**:
  - Short trips (<2 miles) account for 60% of total volume
  - Medium trips (2-3 miles) represent 35% of rides

### 4. Revenue Insights
- **Demand vs Revenue Correlation**: Scatter plot analysis reveals Manhattan as the primary revenue generator
- **Payment Patterns**: Distribution across cash, credit, and digital payment methods

## 🔄 Data Pipeline Implementation

### 1. Data Ingestion (Airflow DAG: `download_to_S3.py`)
```python
- Automated monthly downloads from NYC TLC
- Streaming download with chunked processing for large files (100MB+)
- Error handling and retry logic
- Direct upload to S3 bucket: s3://nyctaxiproject2025/nyc-taxi/
```

### 2. Data Loading (Snowflake COPY)
```sql
- Bulk loading from S3 using Snowflake stages
- COPY INTO operations with MATCH_BY_COLUMN_NAME
- Parquet format optimization
```

### 3. Data Transformation (dbt Models)

**Staging Layer** (`L2_PROCESSING`):
- `stg_taxi`: Unified taxi trip data with standardization
- Dimensional models: `dim_date`, `dim_location`, `dim_vendor`, `dim_paymenttype`
- Fact table: `fact_trip` with business metrics

**Mart Layer** (`L3_CONSUMPTION`):
- `trip_patterns_analysis`: Pre-aggregated trip patterns by time and location
- `pricing_analysis`: Revenue and fare analytics

### 4. Orchestration (Apache Airflow)
```python
DAG: s3_to_snowflake_dbt
- Schedule: Monthly execution
- Task dependencies: Extract → Load → Transform → Quality Check
- Integration with Cosmos for dbt orchestration
- Metadata logging for audit trails
```

## 🚀 Performance Optimizations

- **Incremental Processing**: Only process new data using dbt incremental models
- **Partitioning Strategy**: Monthly partitions on pickup_date for query optimization
- **Clustering**: Location-based clustering for geographic queries
- **Caching**: Materialized views for frequently accessed aggregations
