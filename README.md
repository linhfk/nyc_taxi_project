## NYC Taxi Trip End to End Cloud Data Pipeline and Data Analysis Project

### Introduction
This NYC Taxi Trip Analytics project is an innovative end-to-end Data Engineering pipeline designed to transform urban mobility data into actionable business intelligence. The workflow begins by sourcing Yellow Taxi and Green Taxi data from NYC TLC, followed by storing raw data efficiently in AWS S3 buckets. The data is then meticulously transformed using dbt to ensure accuracy and completeness before being loaded into Snowflake for advanced analytics and querying. To orchestrate the entire process, Apache Airflow automates the data pipeline, while Superset creates visually compelling dashboards that reveal urban movement patterns.
